# Blue Coat reverse-proxy authentication, by default disabled (false)
# Be careful with switching it to 'true' - do it only if you know what you are doing.
# Authentication with Blue Coat means that all HTTP requests having 'Client-Cert' header will be authenticated
# as username placed in the header.
# Never expose SMP to the WEB without properly configured reverse-proxy and active blue coat.
authentication.blueCoat.enabled=false

## Only set to false in PRODUCTION mode. This variable is used to clear the context path of the SMP
contextPath.output=true

## Most Java libraries and J2EE containers block encoded slashes in URL - For security reasons.
## Theoretically there are no restrictions on slash "/" characters in document or participant identifiers,
## but by default we block then as well.
## If slash "/" characters must be supported, than switch this property to "true".
## Remember that in such case the relevant change should be also applied on J2EE level
## I.e. for Tomcat it is handled by property: org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH=true
encodedSlashesAllowedInUrl=false

## Participant Identifier Schema of each PUT ServiceGroup request is validated against this schema
## I.e this regex: ^(?!^.{26})([a-z0-9]+-[a-z0-9]+-[a-z0-9]+)
## - limits length of scheme to 25 characters
## - forces pattern to consist of 3 alpha-numeric segments delimited with "-", i.e: aa1-bb2-cc3
## To turn validation OFF, set regex to "match all":  .*
identifiersBehaviour.ParticipantIdentifierScheme.validationRegex=^(?!^.{26})([a-z0-9]+-[a-z0-9]+-[a-z0-9]+)

## All Identifiers by default are CASE-INSENSITIVE.
## Specifies schemes of participant/document identifiers that must be considered CASE-SENSITIVE.
## List values (delimited by pipe character: "|" ) placed here are checked against runtime (request) schemes in the CASE-INSENSITIVE way
